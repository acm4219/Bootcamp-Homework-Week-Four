# Bootcamp Homework Four
## Quiz Challenge

### Description
This application is supposed to be a working multiple choice quiz that registers correct answers and leads to a submit score page that links to a high score page.
Unfortunately I was not able to complete the application but it still is able to cyle through the questions and utilize the timer function as will be explained below.

### Live Site

### Usage
To begin the quiz after reading the instructions about the quiz you click the start button where you will be presented multiple choice questions. By selecting the correct answer out of the multiple choices presented you move the quiz forward. A timer runs while you are taking this quiz and depending on how quickly you finish the quiz you are able to get the remaining time as a score. After that you are redirected to a page with a chance to submit your high score with your initials and create a leaderboard of sorts. On that same page you are able to reset the leaderboard if needed and go back to the main quiz from there.

### Challenges
Unfortunately I was not able to figure out how to get the question checker working to get the answers to progress as I want them to. Additionally I was not able to get the final question to link directly to the high score page after the correct answer was clicked. In that line with the high score page I was unable to get the form to submit the initials and the score from the prior page and link the reset button to clear the local memory of the high scores. Overall this was an incredibly difficult assignment and I certainly need to practice my skills to make something this complex in the future.

### Credits
I was able to create what I did from working with our instructor at the bootcamp as well as some online resources like MDN to put together what I currently have submitted.
